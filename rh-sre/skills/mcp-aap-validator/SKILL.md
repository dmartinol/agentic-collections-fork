# MCP AAP Validator

Validates that AAP (Ansible Automation Platform) MCP servers are properly configured and accessible for job management and inventory operations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Validating AAP MCP server configuration before job template operations
- Troubleshooting connection issues with AAP MCP servers
- Verifying environment setup for AAP workflows
- Other skills need to confirm AAP MCP server availability as a prerequisite (e.g., `job-template-creator`)

Do NOT use when:
- Creating job templates → Use `job-template-creator` skill instead
- Launching jobs → Use `playbook-executor` or job management skills instead
- Querying inventories → Use `fleet-inventory` skill instead

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check MCP Server Configuration

**Action**: Verify that AAP MCP servers exist in [.mcp.json](../../.mcp.json)

**Required AAP MCP Servers**:
- `aap-mcp-job-management` - Job template and execution management
- `aap-mcp-inventory-management` - Inventory and host management

**Note**: Additional AAP MCP servers may be added in the future. This validator checks all configured `aap-mcp-*` servers.

**How to verify**:
1. Read the `.mcp.json` file in the rh-sre directory
2. Check if `mcpServers` object contains both required servers:
   - `aap-mcp-job-management` key
   - `aap-mcp-inventory-management` key
3. Verify each server configuration has:
   - `type: "http"` or `url` field
   - `headers` with Authorization Bearer token
   - `env` with required variables

**Expected result**: Both AAP MCP servers configured with proper HTTP structure

**Report to user**:
- ✓ "MCP server `aap-mcp-job-management` is configured in .mcp.json"
- ✓ "MCP server `aap-mcp-inventory-management` is configured in .mcp.json"
- ✗ "MCP server `aap-mcp-job-management` not found in .mcp.json"
- ✗ "MCP server `aap-mcp-inventory-management` not found in .mcp.json"

**If either AAP server missing**: Proceed to Human Notification Protocol (Step 4)

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

**Action**: Check that required environment variables are set (without exposing values)

**Required Environment Variables**:
- `AAP_SERVER` - Base URL for AAP instance
- `AAP_API_TOKEN` - Authentication token for AAP API

**CRITICAL SECURITY CONSTRAINT**:
- **NEVER print environment variable values** in user-visible output
- Only report presence/absence
- Do NOT use `echo $VAR_NAME` or display actual values
- Protect sensitive data like API tokens

**How to verify** (without exposing values):
```bash
# Check if set (exit code only, no output)
test -n "$AAP_SERVER"
test -n "$AAP_API_TOKEN"

# Or check and report boolean result
if [ -n "$AAP_SERVER" ]; then
  echo "✓ AAP_SERVER is set"
else
  echo "✗ AAP_SERVER is not set"
fi

if [ -n "$AAP_API_TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "✓ AAP_API_TOKEN is set"
else
  echo "✗ AAP_API_TOKEN is not set"
fi
```

**Report to user**:
- ✓ "Environment variable AAP_SERVER is set"
- ✓ "Environment variable AAP_API_TOKEN is set"
- ✗ "Environment variable AAP_SERVER is not set"
- ✗ "Environment variable AAP_API_TOKEN is not set"

**If missing**: Proceed to Human Notification Protocol (Step 4)

### Step 3: Test MCP Server Connection

**Action**: Attempt connectivity test to verify server accessibility

**Test approach**:
1. **Test Job Management Server**:
   - Tool: `job_templates_list` (from aap-mcp-job-management)
   - Parameters: `page_size: 1` (minimal query)
   - Expected: Returns list (even if empty)
   - Success: Server responds with valid data
   - Failure: Connection timeout, auth error, or server unavailable

2. **Test Inventory Management Server**:
   - Tool: `inventories_list` (from aap-mcp-inventory-management)
   - Parameters: `page_size: 1` (minimal query)
   - Expected: Returns list (even if empty)
   - Success: Server responds with valid data
   - Failure: Connection timeout, auth error, or server unavailable

**Report to user**:
- ✓ "Successfully connected to aap-mcp-job-management"
- ✓ "Successfully connected to aap-mcp-inventory-management"
- ⚠ "Configuration appears correct but connectivity test unavailable"
- ✗ "Cannot connect to aap-mcp-job-management (check server status and credentials)"
- ✗ "Cannot connect to aap-mcp-inventory-management (check server status and credentials)"

**Common connection errors for AAP MCP servers**:
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or expired AAP_API_TOKEN
- `403 Forbidden`: Token lacks required permissions
- `404 Not Found`: Incorrect AAP_SERVER URL or missing endpoints
- `Connection timeout`: Server unreachable or network issue
- `SSL/TLS error`: Certificate verification issues

**If AAP connection fails**: Proceed to Human Notification Protocol (Step 4)
**If ansible connection fails**: Report warning but allow continuation (playbook execution will not be available)

### Step 4: Human Notification Protocol

When validation fails, follow this protocol:

**1. Stop Execution Immediately** - Do not attempt MCP tool calls

**2. Report Clear Error**:

For missing MCP server configuration:
```
❌ Cannot validate AAP MCP servers: Servers not configured in .mcp.json

📋 Setup Instructions:
1. Add AAP MCP server configurations to rh-sre/.mcp.json
2. Configuration template:
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "aap-mcp-job-management": {
         "url": "https://${AAP_SERVER}/job_management/mcp",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer ${AAP_API_TOKEN}"
         }
       },
       "aap-mcp-inventory-management": {
         "url": "https://${AAP_SERVER}/inventory_management/mcp",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer ${AAP_API_TOKEN}"
         }
       }
     }
   }

🔗 Documentation: See rh-sre/README.md for AAP MCP setup
```

For missing environment variables:
```
❌ Cannot validate AAP MCP: Required environment variables not set

📋 Setup Instructions:
1. Set required environment variables:
   export AAP_SERVER="https://your-aap-server.com"
   export AAP_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"

2. To get an API token:
   - Log in to AAP Web UI
   - Navigate to Users → [Your User] → Tokens
   - Create a new Personal Access Token
   - Copy the token value

⚠️ SECURITY: Never commit tokens to source control
   - Use environment variables or secure secret management
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Restrict token permissions to minimum required

3. Restart to reload environment variables

🔗 Documentation: See AAP documentation for authentication setup
```

For connection failures:
```
❌ Cannot connect to AAP MCP servers

📋 Troubleshooting steps:
1. Verify AAP server is accessible:
   - Check AAP_SERVER URL is correct
   - Test connectivity: curl -I ${AAP_SERVER}
   - Verify network connectivity and firewall rules

2. Verify API token is valid:
   - Token may have expired
   - Check token permissions in AAP Web UI
   - Generate new token if needed

3. Check AAP MCP endpoints:
   - Job Management: ${AAP_SERVER}/job_management/mcp
   - Inventory Management: ${AAP_SERVER}/inventory_management/mcp
   - Verify endpoints are exposed and accessible

4. Review authentication errors:
   - 401: Token invalid or expired → Regenerate token
   - 403: Insufficient permissions → Check RBAC settings
   - 404: Endpoint not found → Verify AAP MCP is deployed

5. Check AAP service status:
   - Verify AAP platform is running
   - Check AAP MCP proxy/gateway is operational
   - Review AAP logs for errors

6. Restart to reload MCP servers after configuration changes
```

**3. Request User Decision**:
```
❓ How would you like to proceed?

Options:
- "setup" - Help me configure the AAP MCP servers now
- "skip" - Skip validation and try the operation anyway (not recommended)
- "abort" - Stop the workflow entirely

Please respond with your choice.
```

**4. Wait for Explicit User Input** - Do not proceed automatically

### Step 5: Validation Summary

**Action**: Report overall validation status

**Success case**:
```
✓ AAP MCP Validation: PASSED

Configuration:
✓ MCP server aap-mcp-job-management configured in .mcp.json
✓ MCP server aap-mcp-inventory-management configured in .mcp.json
✓ Environment variable AAP_SERVER is set
✓ Environment variable AAP_API_TOKEN is set
✓ Job management server connectivity verified
✓ Inventory management server connectivity verified

Ready to execute AAP operations.

Available capabilities:
- Job template management (list, retrieve, launch)
- Job execution tracking (status, events, logs)
- Inventory management (hosts, groups, variables)
- System context gathering for remediation
```

**Partial success case**:
```
⚠ AAP MCP Validation: PARTIAL

Configuration:
✓ MCP servers configured in .mcp.json
✓ Environment variables are set
⚠ Server connectivity could not be tested

Note: Configuration appears correct, but full validation requires connectivity test.
You may proceed with caution. Connection will be verified on first tool use.
```

**Failure case**:
```
✗ AAP MCP Validation: FAILED

Issues found:
✗ [Specific issue 1]
✗ [Specific issue 2]

See troubleshooting steps above. Please resolve configuration issues before proceeding.
```

- [AAP Authentication Guide](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/)

## Validation Freshness Policy

**Session-based validation**: Once validation succeeds in a session, subsequent skills can skip re-validation unless:
1. User explicitly requests re-validation
2. Previous MCP tool call failed with connection error
3. Configuration changes were made to .mcp.json
4. Environment variables were modified

**How other skills use this**:
```
IF validation_passed_in_session AND no_config_changes:
  Skip validation, proceed with operation
ELSE:
  Invoke mcp-aap-validator skill
  IF validation PASSED:
    Mark validation_passed_in_session = true
    Proceed with operation
  ELSE:
    Report error, ask user for decision
```

   - Restrict token permissions to minimum required

3. Restart to reload environment variables

🔗 Documentation: See AAP documentation for authentication setup

❓ How would you like to proceed?

Options:
- "setup" - Help me configure environment variables now
- "skip" - Skip validation and try anyway (not recommended)
- "abort" - Stop the workflow entirely

Please respond with your choice.
```

### Example 3: Connection Failure - Invalid Credentials

**User Query**: "Verify AAP MCP is working"

**Skill Response**:
```
I'll validate your AAP MCP configuration.

Checking MCP server configuration...
✓ MCP server `aap-mcp-job-management` is configured in .mcp.json
✓ MCP server `aap-mcp-inventory-management` is configured in .mcp.json

Checking environment variables...
✓ Environment variable AAP_SERVER is set
✓ Environment variable AAP_API_TOKEN is set

Testing server connectivity...
✗ Cannot connect to aap-mcp-job-management (401 Unauthorized)

❌ Cannot connect to AAP MCP servers

📋 Troubleshooting steps:
1. Verify API token is valid:
   - Error 401 indicates authentication failure
   - Token may have expired
   - Generate new token in AAP Web UI:
     Users → [Your User] → Tokens → Add

2. Test token manually:
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AAP_API_TOKEN}" \
        ${AAP_SERVER}/api/controller/v2/ping/

3. If token is valid but error persists:
   - Check AAP MCP proxy/gateway configuration
   - Verify token has required permissions (RBAC)
   - Review AAP logs for authentication errors

4. After fixing, restart to reload configuration

❓ How would you like to proceed?

- "skip" - Skip validation and try anyway
- "abort" - Stop the workflow entirely

Please respond with your choice.
```

### Example 4: Invoked by Another Skill

**Context**: The `job-template-creator` skill invokes this validator before attempting template creation

**Internal workflow**:
```
[job-template-creator skill] → [Invoke mcp-aap-validator]
                             ← [Validation result: PASSED/PARTIAL/FAILED]
[job-template-creator skill] → [If PASSED: proceed with template creation]
                             → [If PARTIAL: warn user, ask to proceed]
                             → [If FAILED: report to user, ask for decision]
```

This skill provides a reusable validation check that other skills can invoke as a prerequisite before AAP MCP operations.

## Best Practices

1. **Invoke once per session** - Cache validation result for efficiency
2. **Security first** - Never expose environment variable values
3. **Clear error messages** - Provide actionable troubleshooting steps
4. **Test both servers** - Job management AND inventory management
5. **Verify permissions** - Ensure token has required RBAC roles
6. **Document prerequisites** - Help users understand what's needed
7. **Graceful degradation** - Allow operations even with partial validation (with warnings)
8. **Token rotation** - Remind users to rotate tokens regularly
9. **Connection pooling** - Reuse connections when possible
10. **Timeout handling** - Set appropriate timeouts for connectivity tests
