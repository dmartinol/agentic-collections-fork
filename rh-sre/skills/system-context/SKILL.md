  **CRITICAL**: This skill must be used for system inventory and context gathering. DO NOT use raw MCP tools like get_cve_systems or get_host_details directly.

  Gather comprehensive system inventory and deployment context for CVE-affected systems, including RHEL version detection, environment classification, and deployment analysis. Use this skill when you need to understand system infrastructure before planning remediation.

  This skill orchestrates MCP tools (get_cve_systems, get_host_details) to provide comprehensive system analysis with RHEL version detection, environment classification, and remediation strategy determination.

  **IMPORTANT**: ALWAYS use this skill instead of calling get_cve_systems or get_host_details directly for system context gathering.

# System Context Gathering Skill

This skill gathers comprehensive system inventory and deployment context for CVE-affected systems, enabling informed remediation strategy decisions.

**Integration with Remediator Agent**: The sre-agents:remediator agent (invoked) orchestrates this skill as part of its Step 3 (Gather Context) workflow. For standalone system analysis, you can invoke this skill directly.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill directly when you need**:
- Understand which systems are affected by a CVE
- Analyze deployment architecture (Kubernetes, bare metal, VMs)
- Detect RHEL versions across infrastructure
- Classify systems by environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Gather context before remediation planning

**Use the sre-agents:remediator agent when you need**:
- End-to-end CVE remediation workflow
- Integrated analysis → context → playbook → execution
- Automated remediation strategy determination

**How they work together**: The sre-agents:remediator agent (invoked) uses this skill's output to determine remediation strategy (batch vs individual, Kubernetes pod eviction requirements, maintenance window needs, etc.).

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Affected Systems

**MCP Tool**: `get_cve_systems` or `vulnerability__get_cve_systems` (from lightspeed-mcp)

**Parameters**:
- `cve_id`: Exact CVE identifier (format: `"CVE-YYYY-NNNNN"`)
  - Example: `"CVE-2024-1234"`
- `limit`: Optional number of systems to return (default: all)
  - Example: `100`
  - Use for large deployments to paginate results
- `offset`: Optional pagination offset (default: 0)
  - Example: `0`
  - Use with limit for pagination

**Expected Output**: List of system UUIDs and basic metadata

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "systems": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-1",
      "hostname": "web-server-01",
      "display_name": "web-server-01.prod.example.com"
    },
    {
      "id": "uuid-2",
      "hostname": "web-server-02",
      "display_name": "web-server-02.prod.example.com"
    }
  ],
  "total": 2
}
```

### 2. Gather Detailed System Information

**MCP Tool**: `get_host_details` or `inventory__get_host_details` (from lightspeed-mcp)

**Parameters**:
- `system_id`: UUID of the system to retrieve (from get_cve_systems result)
  - Example: `"uuid-1"`
  - Format: UUID string
- `include_system_profile`: `true` (retrieve complete system profile including packages, services)
  - Example: `true`
  - Recommended: Always true for context gathering
- `include_tags`: Optional boolean to include system tags (default: true)
  - Example: `true`
  - Tags provide environment, role, criticality classification

**Expected Output**: Detailed system profile

**Key Information to Extract**:
- RHEL version (rhel_version, os_release)
- System type (infrastructure_type: bare_metal, virtualized, container)
- IP addresses (network_interfaces)
- Tags (environment, role, criticality)
- System profile (CPU, memory, disk)
- Installed packages (installed_packages)
- Running services (enabled_services, running_processes)
- Last check-in time (updated)

**System Profile Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-1",
  "hostname": "web-server-01",
  "display_name": "web-server-01.prod.example.com",
  "rhel_version": "8.9",
  "os_release": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.9 (Ootpa)",
  "system_profile": {
    "os_release": "8.9",
    "arch": "x86_64",
    "kernel_version": "4.18.0-513.el8.x86_64",
    "number_of_cpus": 4,
    "number_of_sockets": 1,
    "cores_per_socket": 4,
    "system_memory_bytes": 17179869184,
    "infrastructure_type": "virtualized",
    "infrastructure_vendor": "kvm",
    "network_interfaces": [
      {
        "name": "eth0",
        "ipv4_addresses": ["10.0.1.10"]
      }
    ],
    "installed_packages": [...],
    "enabled_services": ["httpd", "sshd", ...],
    "running_processes": [...]
  },
  "tags": [
    {"namespace": "environment", "key": "env", "value": "production"},
    {"namespace": "role", "key": "role", "value": "web-server"},
    {"namespace": "criticality", "key": "level", "value": "high"}
  ]
}
```

### 3. Analyze Deployment Context

Synthesize gathered information to understand deployment architecture:

**A. RHEL Version Distribution**:
```
Affected Systems by RHEL Version:
- RHEL 7: 3 systems (15%)
- RHEL 8: 15 systems (75%)
- RHEL 9: 2 systems (10%)

Remediation Consideration:
→ Playbook must support multiple RHEL versions (use conditional yum/dnf)
```

**B. Environment Classification**:
```
Affected Systems by Environment:
- Production: 12 systems (60%) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Staging: 5 systems (25%) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Development: 3 systems (15%) - LOW PRIORITY

Remediation Strategy:
→ Remediate staging first for validation
→ Schedule maintenance window for production
→ Development can be patched anytime
```

**C. System Type Distribution**:
```
Affected Systems by Type:
- Bare metal: 12 systems (60%) - STANDARD REMEDIATION
- VMs (VMware): 8 systems (40%) - STANDARD REMEDIATION

Deployment Type:
→ Standard remediation workflow
→ Consider reboot requirements
→ Schedule maintenance windows for critical systems
```

**D. System Criticality**:
```
Affected Systems by Criticality:
- Critical (payment, auth): 5 systems - NEEDS MAINTENANCE WINDOW
- High (web, api): 10 systems - NEEDS TESTING
- Medium (internal tools): 3 systems - STANDARD DEPLOYMENT
- Low (dev, test): 2 systems - IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT OK

Remediation Approach:
→ Test on low-criticality systems first
→ Schedule maintenance for critical systems
→ Use rolling updates for high-availability services
```

### 5. Determine Remediation Strategy

Based on gathered context, recommend remediation strategy:

**Decision Matrix**:

| Context | Remediation Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| Single system, non-K8s | Standard playbook, immediate execution possible |
| Multiple systems, same RHEL version | Batch playbook, parallel execution |
| Multiple systems, mixed RHEL versions | Batch playbook with version conditionals |
| Kubernetes nodes | Rolling update with pod eviction |
| Critical production systems | Maintenance window required, staged rollout |
| Mixed environments | Remediate staging → validate → production |

**Strategy Output**:
```yaml
remediation_strategy:
  approach: "rolling_update"  # or "batch", "individual", "staged"

  requires_maintenance_window: true
  suggested_window: "Weekend, off-peak hours"

  requires_pod_eviction: true
  pod_eviction_strategy: "one_node_at_a_time"

  batch_size: 5
  parallel_execution: true

  test_first_on:
    - "staging-web-01"
    - "staging-web-02"

  rollout_order:
    - phase: "validation"
      systems: ["staging-web-01", "staging-web-02"]
      wait_for_verification: true

    - phase: "production_batch_1"
      systems: ["prod-web-01", "prod-web-02", "prod-web-03"]
      requires_approval: true

    - phase: "production_batch_2"
      systems: ["prod-web-04", "prod-web-05"]
      requires_approval: false

  estimated_duration_minutes: 60
  estimated_downtime_per_system: 5
```

### 6. Return Context Summary

## Recommended Remediation Strategy

**Approach**: Rolling Update with Pod Eviction

**Execution Plan**:
1. **Phase 1 - Validation** (Staging):
   - Systems: staging-web-01, staging-web-02 (5 systems)
   - Test playbook execution
   - Verify no issues before production

2. **Phase 2 - Production Batch 1**:
   - Systems: prod-web-01 to prod-web-05 (5 systems)
   - Requires approval after staging validation
   - Rolling update with pod eviction

3. **Phase 3 - Production Batch 2**:
   - Systems: prod-web-06 to prod-web-10 (5 systems)
   - Continue if Batch 1 successful

**Requirements**:
- Maintenance window: Weekend off-peak hours
- Pod eviction strategy: One node at a time
- Batch size: 5 systems (parallel execution)
- Estimated duration: 60 minutes total
- Estimated downtime per system: ~5 minutes

**Safety Measures**:
- Test in staging first
- Rolling updates maintain service availability
- PodDisruptionBudgets respected
- Rollback capability via snapshots (RHEL 8/9)

## Next Steps
1. Review remediation strategy
2. Schedule maintenance window for production
3. Generate remediation playbook (use playbook-generator skill)
4. Execute in staging for validation
5. Proceed with production deployment
```

### Example 3: Multi-Environment Deployment

**User Request**: "Gather context for CVE affecting dev, staging, and prod"

**Skill Response**:
1. Call `get_cve_systems` → 20 systems across 3 environments
2. Call `get_host_details` → Extract environment tags
3. Classify by environment → 3 dev, 5 staging, 12 prod
4. Determine criticality → Production has critical services
5. Return staged strategy: "Test on dev (3 systems) → Validate on staging (5 systems) → Deploy to production with approval (12 systems)"

## Error Handling

**No systems affected**:
```
CVE-YYYY-NNNNN Analysis Complete

Good news! No systems in your infrastructure are currently affected by this CVE.

Possible reasons:
- Systems are already patched
- Vulnerable packages are not installed
- Systems are running different versions

No remediation required.
```

**Lightspeed inventory access error**:
```
Unable to retrieve system details from Red Hat Lightspeed inventory.

Possible causes:
- Systems not registered to Red Hat Lightspeed
- Lightspeed inventory sync pending
- API authentication issue

Suggestions:
- Verify systems are registered: subscription-manager status
- Check Lightspeed connection: insights-client --status
- Re-run inventory sync: insights-client --register
```

**System tagging incomplete**:
```
Unable to fully classify systems due to incomplete tagging.

Proceeding with Red Hat Lightspeed data only.
Note: Environment and criticality tags missing from some systems.

To improve system classification:
1. Add environment tags to systems in Red Hat Lightspeed
2. Add criticality/role tags for better prioritization
3. Ensure all systems are registered and reporting
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always gather full context** - Don't skip system details even if deployment seems simple
2. **Classify by environment** - Always test in staging before production deployment
3. **Check system criticality** - Remediation strategy depends on system importance (critical vs low)
4. **Respect criticality tags** - High-criticality systems need maintenance windows and extra care
5. **Detect RHEL version mix** - Playbooks must handle multiple versions (conditional dnf/yum logic)
6. **Consider batch size** - Balance speed vs risk (5-10 systems per batch recommended)
7. **Plan for rollback** - Always have a backup strategy (snapshots, maintenance windows)
8. **Use pagination for large fleets** - If get_cve_systems returns 100+ systems, use limit/offset parameters

## Integration with Other Skills
