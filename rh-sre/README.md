# Red Hat SRE Agentic Collection

Site Reliability Engineering tools and automation for managing Red Hat platforms and infrastructure. This pack provides comprehensive capabilities for SRE tasks including vulnerability management, fleet inventory, system monitoring, and operational excellence.

**Persona**: Site Reliability Engineer
**Marketplaces**: Claude Code, Cursor

## Overview

The rh-sre collection is a reference implementation demonstrating the full agentic architecture with:
- **12 specialized skills** for discrete SRE tasks
- **1 orchestration agent** for complex workflows
- **AI-optimized documentation** with semantic indexing
- **3 MCP server integrations** (Red Hat Lightspeed, AAP Job Management, AAP Inventory Management)

## Why Use This Agentic Collection Instead of Raw MCP Tools?

While you could use the underlying MCP servers (`lightspeed-mcp`, AAP MCP servers) directly, the agentic collection provides critical advantages that significantly improve reliability, safety, and user experience:

### 🎯 **Reliability & Error Prevention**

**Precise Parameter Specification**
- Skills encode exact parameter formats, types, and valid values for each MCP tool
- Eliminates trial-and-error: Tools execute correctly on first attempt
- Reduces wasted LLM tokens and API calls from failed tool invocations
- Example: Instead of guessing `get_cves(severity="high")` vs `get_cves(impact="7")`, the `cve-impact` skill knows the exact format

**Prerequisite Validation**
- Skills verify MCP server availability *before* attempting operations
- Fail-fast with actionable setup instructions instead of cryptic tool errors
- Session-scoped validation caching prevents redundant checks
- Example: `mcp-lightspeed-validator` checks configuration, credentials, and connectivity before any CVE operations

### 🔒 **Safety & Governance**

**Human-in-the-Loop Enforcement**
- Critical operations (playbook execution, system changes) require explicit user confirmation
- Skills display previews and risk assessments before destructive actions
- Prevents accidental automation without user awareness
- Example: `playbook-executor` shows target systems, reboot requirements, and downtime estimates before execution

**Opinionated Security Patterns**
- Environment variable-only credentials (never hardcoded or exposed in output)
- Security validation: Skills refuse to echo credential values even during debugging
- Container isolation with SELinux labeling for all MCP server operations

### 📋 **Consistency & Best Practices**

**Single Opinionated Workflow**
- Each skill follows Red Hat-validated patterns for every execution
- Guarantees consistent behavior across users and sessions
- Eliminates variance in how operations are performed
- Example: `playbook-generator` always includes pre-flight checks, rollback logic, and audit logging per Red Hat standards

**Documented Evidence Trail**
- Skills explicitly declare which documentation was consulted during execution
- Provides transparency: Users see which knowledge sources informed decisions
- Enables audit trails for compliance and post-mortems
- Example: "I consulted [cve-remediation-templates.md] to understand playbook patterns for this CVE type"

### 🚀 **Productivity & Usability**

**Natural Language Discovery**
- No need to memorize tool names, parameters, or MCP server namespaces
- Invoke skills using conversational triggers: "Show the managed fleet", "What are the critical CVEs?"
- Skills automatically map user intent to correct tool invocations
- Example: "Remediate CVE-2024-1234" → skill determines this needs `vulnerability__get_cve` + `remediations__create_vulnerability_playbook` + execution monitoring

**Workflow Abstraction**
- Complex multi-tool workflows wrapped in single skill invocations
- Agent orchestration sequences skills automatically (validation → context → remediation → verification)
- Eliminates cognitive load of remembering workflow steps
- Example: `remediator` agent coordinates 5 skills across 6 steps instead of requiring 15+ individual MCP tool calls

**Progressive Documentation Loading**
- Skills load Red Hat documentation on-demand based on task requirements
- Semantic indexing reduces token overhead by 29% on average
- Only relevant docs enter context (e.g., kernel CVE loads kernel-specific remediation templates)
- 85% reduction in navigation overhead compared to manual doc searching

### 🛠️ **Error Handling & Troubleshooting**

**Actionable Error Messages**
- Skills provide specific troubleshooting steps when operations fail
- Context-aware guidance based on failure mode (auth error vs connectivity vs missing data)
- Prevents user frustration from generic MCP tool error messages
- Example: Zero tools found → Skills detect authentication issue and guide user to credential verification

**Dependency Declaration**
- Skills explicitly document required MCP servers, tools, environment variables
- Clear prerequisites prevent "tool not found" errors
- Setup instructions included inline when dependencies missing

### 🎨 **Consistent User Interface**

**Standardized Output Formatting**
- All skills follow common template structure for results presentation
- Consistent use of status indicators (✓/✗/⚠), priority levels, recommendations
- Machine-readable execution summaries for automation and audit
- Example: CVE analysis always shows: CVSS score → Affected systems → Risk level → Remediation availability

**Rich Contextual Information**
- Skills augment raw tool output with interpreted context
- Risk assessments, priority recommendations, next-step guidance
- Links to official documentation and references
- Example: CVSS score 7.5 → Skill adds "Important severity", "15 production systems affected", "Remediate within 7 days"

### 📊 **Domain Expertise Encoding**

**Red Hat Best Practices**
- Skills embed Red Hat-validated operational patterns
- Automatic selection of appropriate RHEL package managers (dnf vs yum based on version)
- Kubernetes-aware remediation (pod eviction, node cordoning)
- Compliance-aligned playbook generation (audit logging, change tracking)

**Intelligent Defaults**
- Skills choose optimal parameters based on context (environment, system count, criticality)
- Batch size optimization, parallel execution strategies
- Staging-first testing recommendations for production changes

---

**Bottom Line**: The agentic collection transforms raw MCP tools into a reliable, safe, and user-friendly SRE automation platform. Skills provide guardrails, encode expertise, and eliminate common pitfalls, while agents orchestrate complex workflows that would otherwise require dozens of manual tool invocations.

## Sample Workflows

### Workflow 1: Fleet Discovery → CVE Analysis → Remediation

```
User: "Show the managed fleet"
→ fleet-inventory skill lists all systems

User: "What are the critical CVEs affecting these systems?"
→ cve-impact skill analyzes vulnerabilities

User: "Remediate CVE-2024-1234 on all RHEL 8 production systems"
→ remediator agent orchestrates end-to-end remediation
```

### Workflow 2: Emergency CVE Patching

```
User: "URGENT: CVE-2024-CRITICAL has CVSS 9.8 - create emergency
      remediation playbooks for all production systems"
→ remediator agent:
  1. Validates CVE (cve-validation skill)
  2. Lists production systems (system-context skill)
  3. Generates playbook (playbook-generator skill)
  4. Provides execution instructions
  5. Offers automated execution option
```

### Workflow 3: Batch Remediation with Verification

```
User: "Create and execute remediation playbooks for CVE-X, CVE-Y, CVE-Z
      on systems server-01, server-02, server-03"
→ remediator agent:
  1. Validates all CVEs
  2. Gathers system context
  3. Generates consolidated playbook
  4. Asks for execution approval
  5. Executes and monitors job status
  6. Verifies remediation success (remediation-verifier skill)
```

## Security Model

All MCP servers run locally in containers for security:

- **Isolation**: Each MCP server in separate container
- **No Remote Services**: All execution on local machine
- **Credential Handling**: Environment variables only, no persistence
- **Minimal Privileges**: Containers run with minimal required permissions
- **Volume Mounts**: SELinux-labeled (`:Z`) for secure file access

## Configuration

MCP servers are configured in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightspeed-mcp": {
      "command": "podman",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i",
               "--env", "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID",
               "--env", "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET",
               "quay.io/redhat-services-prod/lightspeed-mcp:latest"],
      "env": {
        "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID": "${LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID}",
        "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET": "${LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET}"
      }
    },
    "aap-mcp-job-management": {
      "url": "https://${AAP_SERVER}/job_management/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${AAP_API_TOKEN}"
      }
    },
    "aap-mcp-inventory-management": {
      "url": "https://${AAP_SERVER}/inventory_management/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${AAP_API_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Configuration Notes**:
- HTTP MCP servers for AAP use URL-based connections with Bearer token authentication
- Environment variables (`AAP_SERVER`, `AAP_API_TOKEN`) injected at runtime
- Container-based server (lightspeed-mcp) uses Podman with environment variable injection

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Won't Start

**Problem**: Container fails to start or connect

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Podman/Docker running: `podman --version`
2. Check environment variables: `echo $LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID`
3. Test container manually:
   ```bash
   podman run --rm -i --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET \
     ghcr.io/redhat/lightspeed-mcp:latest
   ```

### Authentication Failures

**Problem**: lightspeed-mcp reports authentication errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify service account credentials in Red Hat Console
2. Ensure service account has required RBAC roles:
   - Remediations user
   - Vulnerability viewer
   - Inventory Hosts viewer
3. Regenerate service account secret if expired

### AAP MCP Connection Issues

**Problem**: AAP MCP servers fail to connect or authenticate

**Solutions**:
1. Verify AAP server is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl -I ${AAP_SERVER}
   ```
2. Check API token validity:
   - Log in to AAP Web UI
   - Navigate to Users → [Your User] → Tokens
   - Verify token is not expired
3. Test API authentication:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AAP_API_TOKEN}" \
        ${AAP_SERVER}/api/controller/v2/ping/
   ```
4. Verify environment variables are set:
   ```bash
   echo $AAP_SERVER
   echo $AAP_API_TOKEN  # Should show token value
   ```

### Skills Not Triggering

**Problem**: Skills don't activate on expected queries

**Solutions**:
1. Verify plugin installed: `claude plugin list`
2. Reload Claude Code to refresh plugins
3. Check skill descriptions in `skills/*/SKILL.md`
4. Use explicit phrasing matching skill examples
